# Czapis Game

Silly little clicker game about catching cats!
Made on Electron using JavaScript

# This is a DEMO!
I've always wanted to create a game like this, and finally found a nice and easy way to make this work. But it's only sort of a "demo". Full version will look and feel completly diffrently.
This is just a showcase of what I've been doing for past week. Code of this game is absolute mess, but it's open source, so if you want to make yourself a change, go for it. No need for credits!

### It's very simple: You click cats, they give you money!
Click on cats to catch them. If you manage to catch it, you earn money. Simple as that. 
Buy items and upgrades, find all cats and catch them!
If you find any bugs, please don't report them. I will not work on this demo anymore. It's just a showcase of what game could have been.

## Setup

- Windows <br />
1.Install node.js with [this](https://nodejs.org/en) <br />
2.Open app with "start.bat" file <br />
if you want to change code make sure to install electron in game dir file using ``npm install electron`` in terminal <br />

- Linux and MacOS <br />
1. Open terminal with folder path <br />
2. Make sure you that ``start.sh`` has executable permissions. (``chmod +x start.sh``) <br />
3. Same with Windows, Install node.js with [this](https://nodejs.org/en) if you don't have <br />
4. Run ``./start.sh`` <br />

Fixing instruction: <br />
If game doesn't work for you, you can do one of these <br />
- Check if you have node.js installed (type ``node`` in console) <br />
- Run in terminal ``npm install`` or ``npm install -g electron`` <br />
- Run in terminal ``npm start`` <br />
- Check ``start.sh`` file for any issues <br />
